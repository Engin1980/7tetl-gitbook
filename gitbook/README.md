# Introduction

## Code listings

All code listings, if not mentioned differently, are in Java programming language. If there is some code irrelevant to the presented part, the placeholder `. . .` sequence is used to mark the place where some part of the code was omitted.

Code listings with Java code are formatted with color formatting.

```java
public void getDemo() {
  String s = "This is example of Java code listing.";
  return s;
}
```

Code listings without any color format are typically Console outputs (if not mentioned otherwise).

```
This is example of output code.
This is typically printed to output Console.
```
